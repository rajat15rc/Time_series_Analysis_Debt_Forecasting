Accurately predicted total debts based on a business’s borrowing history by constructing forecasting models (Exponential Smoothening and Prophet) and a predictive ML model (ridge regression) with feature engineering for economic crisis detection. Successfully captured trends, seasonality and cyclicity by statistical analysis tests– ADF and KPF and visualization. Evaluated using MAPE, providing accurate predictions of total debts and valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

<u>Results: The ridge model has a MAPE of 0.072 on the test set. </u>
